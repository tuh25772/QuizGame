# Quiz Game
The Java code provided constitutes a quiz game application that leverages Swing GUI components to create an interactive user interface. It utilizes various Java features 
including Swing's JFrame, JTextField, JTextArea, JButton, JLabel, and Timer to present questions, answer choices, and results visually. Employing arrays for storing questions, 
options, and correct answers, the game dynamically updates the interface with each new question. It implements ActionListener to handle user interactions, enabling users to select 
answers through button clicks. The code employs conditional statements to validate user answers and manages a countdown timer using the javax.swing.Timer class, allowing 10 
seconds for each question. This application also customizes the appearance of GUI elements by setting their properties such as size, color, and font. While encapsulating 
functionalities within the Quiz class, the code implements an object-oriented approach for managing the game's logic, offering an engaging quiz experience where users can
respond to questions within a time limit and view their final scores upon completion.
